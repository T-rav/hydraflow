# Mock at the definition site, not the import site

Patch `hindsight.tombstone_safe`, not `module_under_test.tombstone_safe`; combine with deferred imports inside test methods.

Example: `@patch('hindsight.tombstone_safe')` not `@patch('mymodule.tombstone_safe')`.

**Why:** Import-site patches fail when the import is deferred or when optional dependencies are conditionally loaded — definition-site patches intercept regardless of import order.
