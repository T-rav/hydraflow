# Use claim-then-merge for async queue processing

Atomically claim queue items (clear/load under lock), release lock, perform async work, re-acquire lock, reload new items, merge, then atomically write.

Example: `with lock: batch = queue.copy(); queue.clear()` → async work → `with lock: queue.update(new); queue.update(results); write(queue)`.

**Why:** Releasing the lock during async work avoids deadlock, but re-acquiring before write prevents entries appended during the async gap from being lost.
