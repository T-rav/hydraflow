# Ledger refactors must preserve byte-identical JSONL output

When consolidating store implementations (e.g. `src/escape/ledger.py`, `src/erosion/trends.py`) into a shared base like `src/jsonl_ledger.py`, explicitly test that JSON encoding options, the trailing newline, and malformed-line-skip behavior on `read_all` are unchanged.

Example: assert historical `.jsonl` files on disk still parse the same way after the refactor. See also: patterns — JSONL ledger stores share a generic base in src/jsonl_ledger.py.

**Why:** these stores are append-only logs read by existing pipeline data; a silent encoding or newline change breaks readers of already-written files.
