# In-place diff truncation silently corrupts downstream non-LLM consumers

When a diff is truncated for an LLM prompt, rebind to a separate name rather than mutating the original variable.

Example: `prompt_diff = diff[:max_diff] + "[truncated]"` instead of reassigning `diff`, so the full `diff` is still available for structural consumers.

**Why:** In-place truncation causes coverage mapping to silently under-report changed lines in the tail of large diffs, making the gate fail-open on the diffs most likely to need it.
