# Use SHA-256 truncated to 16 chars for memory dedup keys

Compute dedup keys and recall-hit tracking via `SHA-256(content)[:16]`.

Example: `key = hashlib.sha256(item['text'].encode()).hexdigest()[:16]`.

**Why:** Consistent hashing ensures the same content maps to the same key across process restarts; truncation keeps keys human-scannable in logs.
