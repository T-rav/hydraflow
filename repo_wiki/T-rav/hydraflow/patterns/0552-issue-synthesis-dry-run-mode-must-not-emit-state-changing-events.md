# Dry-run mode must not emit state-changing events

Gate every side-effecting event bus publish behind `if not self.dry_run:` so dry-run mode has no observable side effects.

Example: `if not self.dry_run: self.event_bus.publish(TRIAGE_ROUTING, ...)` is not emitted during dry-run.

**Why:** an emitted event in dry-run triggers downstream label mutations and state transitions, making dry-run non-idempotent.
