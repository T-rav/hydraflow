# Use `file_util.atomic_write()` for critical state file updates

Write critical state via `file_util.atomic_write()`, which writes to a temp file then calls `os.replace()` atomically.

Example: `file_util.atomic_write(state_path, json.dumps(state))` — not `open(path, 'w').write(...)`.

**Why:** A crash mid-write with `open(..., 'w')` truncates the file, producing an empty or partial state that cannot be loaded.
