# Use `file_util.append_jsonl()` for crash-safe JSONL appends

Wrap JSONL appends in `file_util.append_jsonl()`, which calls `flush()` + `os.fsync()` inside a `file_lock()`.

Example: `file_util.append_jsonl(path, record)` — not `with open(path, 'a') as f: f.write(...)`.

**Why:** Bare `open(..., 'a')` without fsync loses the last record on crash; the lock prevents interleaved writes from concurrent processes.
