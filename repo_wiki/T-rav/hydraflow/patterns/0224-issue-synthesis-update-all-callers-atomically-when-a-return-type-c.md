# Update all callers atomically when a return type changes

When a function's return type changes (e.g., `str | None` → `dict | None`), update every caller in a single commit — never in separate PRs.

Example: Change `parse()` return type and grep + update all `result[0]` / `result[1]` unpack sites before committing.

**Why:** A partially-migrated codebase compiles but crashes at runtime on unpatched callers.
