# Extract duplicated JSONL-reading logic to a shared `_load_jsonl()` helper

Shared JSONL-reading logic must be extracted to a `_load_jsonl(path, label)` helper rather than duplicated inline.

Example: `records = _load_jsonl(path, "events")` — one implementation, multiple callers.

**Why:** Inline duplication causes silent divergence when one copy gets a bug fix (e.g., empty-file guard) that the other copies miss.
