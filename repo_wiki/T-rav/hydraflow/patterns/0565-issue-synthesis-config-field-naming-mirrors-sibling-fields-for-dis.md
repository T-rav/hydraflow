# Config field naming mirrors sibling fields for discoverability

New `adr_drift_*` config fields in `src/config.py` should mirror the naming shape of existing sibling fields rather than inventing new conventions.

Example: `adr_drift_shared_infra_fanout_threshold` was named to mirror `adr_drift_fleet_batch_threshold`, keeping the `adr_drift_<concern>_threshold` pattern and its matching `_ENV_INT_OVERRIDES` env var (`HYDRAFLOW_ADR_DRIFT_SHARED_INFRA_FANOUT_THRESHOLD`) consistent with existing overrides.

**Why:** consistent naming lets future readers grep `adr_drift_` in `src/config.py` and immediately infer the env override name without checking `_ENV_INT_OVERRIDES`.
