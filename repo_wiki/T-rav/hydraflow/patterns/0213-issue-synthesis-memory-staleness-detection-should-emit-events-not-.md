# Memory staleness detection should emit events, not silently mutate state

Staleness detection must emit events or log warnings rather than silently deleting or modifying stale entries.

Example: `event_bus.publish(STALE_MEMORY, item_id=item.id, age_days=age)` instead of `self._items.pop(item.id)`.

**Why:** Silent mutation removes the operator's ability to review or override staleness decisions; events keep the action reversible.
