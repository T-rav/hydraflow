# docs/arch/generated/* is a make arch-regen artifact — never hand-edit

Regenerate `docs/arch/generated/*` via `make arch-regen` rather than hand-editing the generated Markdown/Mermaid, e.g. after removing a loop like `PrRedRepairLoop` from `functional_areas.yml`'s quality_gates group.

Example: hand-editing or forgetting to regen reddens the `arch-regen.yml` CI check.

**Why:** the generated docs are a build artifact of the live loop registry, port map, and functional-area map — manual edits silently drift from source on the next real regen.
