# Retarget mock patches to the new location before moving a method

Before moving a method to a new module, update all `@patch` decorators in tests to point to the destination path, then move the implementation.

Example: Change `@patch('old.module.Method')` → `@patch('new.module.Method')` before the move commit.

**Why:** Moving a method without updating patches leaves tests patching a now-unused import, so the live code runs unpatched and the test silently stops covering the real path.
