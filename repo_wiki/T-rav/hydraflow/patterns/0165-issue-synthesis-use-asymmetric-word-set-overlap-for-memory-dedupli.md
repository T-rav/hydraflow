# Use asymmetric word-set overlap for memory deduplication

Compute dedup similarity as `len(words & existing) / max(len(words), 1)` with a configurable threshold (default 0.85).

Example: new item with 10 words sharing 9 with an existing item → score 0.9 → suppress.

**Why:** Symmetric Jaccard penalises short additions to long entries; asymmetric overlap correctly identifies content that's mostly a subset of existing memory.
