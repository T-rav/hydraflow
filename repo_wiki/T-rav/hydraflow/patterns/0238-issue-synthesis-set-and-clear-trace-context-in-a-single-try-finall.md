# Set and clear trace context in a single try/finally block

Set/clear or begin/end pairs for tracing context MUST execute within a single try/finally — never split across separate methods.

Example: `token = ctx.set(val); try: ... finally: ctx.reset(token)` — both in one scope.

**Why:** Splitting the set/clear across call boundaries leaks trace state across issues or loop iterations, corrupting span attribution.
