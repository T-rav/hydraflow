# Lazy-load memory context on explicit user action

Fetch memory context only when the user expands a section — not when the HITL list view renders.

Example: Expand button triggers `fetchMemoryContext(issueId)` — the list view fires no memory API calls.

**Why:** Pre-fetching on render causes N+1 API calls on every HITL list load, amplified by the number of open issues.
