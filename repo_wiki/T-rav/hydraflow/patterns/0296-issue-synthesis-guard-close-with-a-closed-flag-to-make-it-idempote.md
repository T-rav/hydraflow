# Guard `close()` with a `_closed` flag to make it idempotent

All cleanup methods must check and set a `_closed` flag as their first step.

Example: `def close(self): if self._closed: return; self._closed = True; await self._resource.aclose()`.

**Why:** Double-close on an async resource (e.g., HTTP session) raises; idempotent close makes teardown order-independent in test fixtures.
