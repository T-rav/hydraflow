# Memory eviction must atomically update both `item_scores.json` and `items.jsonl`

An eviction operation must write `item_scores.json` and `items.jsonl` together within the same lock scope — never update one without the other.

Example: `atomic_write(scores_path, ...)` then `atomic_write(items_path, ...)` under a single lock acquire.

**Why:** A partial update leaves scores referencing evicted items (or items with stale scores), corrupting ranking on the next eviction pass.
