# ADR-0044 P5 checks require both @register() and an ADR table row

`scripts/hydraflow_audit` checks (e.g. `scripts/hydraflow_audit/checks/p5_ci.py`) are discovered via `@register("P5.N")`, but the audit also parses `docs/adr/0044-hydraflow-principles.md`'s P5 table as the source of truth — registering a check without adding its ADR row (or vice versa) leaves the audit inconsistent.

Example: P5.8–P5.10 landed both together.

**Why:** ADR-0044 is an Accepted ADR; a check present in code but missing from the table (or the reverse) breaks the audit's self-verification and looks like undocumented drift.
