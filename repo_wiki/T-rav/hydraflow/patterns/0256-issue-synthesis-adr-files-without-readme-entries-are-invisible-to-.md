# ADR files without README entries are invisible to tooling

Every ADR file in `docs/adr/` must have a corresponding row in `docs/adr/README.md` to be canonically referenceable.

Example: Adding `docs/adr/0055-new-decision.md` requires a matching `| 0055 | New Decision | Accepted |` row in README.

**Why:** `scan_adr_directory()` builds its index from README rows; a file without a row is silently skipped by drift detection and cross-reference tooling.
