# Use meta-tests to enforce anti-pattern absence across the test suite

Write meta-tests that scan `tests/test_*.py` for forbidden patterns (e.g., `sys.path.insert`, "Should..." docstrings, AAA comments) and fail CI if any are found.

Example: `assert not any('sys.path.insert' in line for line in test_files)` as a standalone test.

**Why:** Manual review misses anti-patterns introduced across hundreds of test files; a meta-test turns the check into a permanent CI gate.
