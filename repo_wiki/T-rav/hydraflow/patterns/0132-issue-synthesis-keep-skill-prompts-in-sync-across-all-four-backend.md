# Keep skill prompts in sync across all four backend locations

Skill prompt text lives in `src/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.pi/skills/`, and `.codex/skills/` — update all four locations when changing a prompt.

Example: editing `.claude/commands/hf.diff-sanity.md` requires mirroring the change to the other three locations.

**Why:** Missed updates cause the same skill to behave differently depending on which backend routes the request, producing inconsistent LLM behavior.
