# refill_interval as opt-in kwarg preserves run_refilling_pool cadence

Add new timing behavior to a shared pool helper as a keyword-only, default-None param — never flip the default for everyone.

Example: `run_refilling_pool(..., refill_interval: float | None = None)` in `src/phase_utils.py` passes the value as `timeout` to `asyncio.wait`, re-polling `supply_fn` on timeout; only `src/plan_phase.py` passes `config.poll_interval`, while triage/implement callers pass nothing and keep polling only on task completion.

**Why:** defaulting the interval on would silently change triage/implement dispatch cadence — a behavior change no one asked for, discoverable only via a prod regression.
