# Grep all call sites before changing a function signature

Run `git grep <function_name>` before modifying any signature; for public functions, verify zero remaining unpatched matches after the change.

Example: `git grep 'load_state'` before changing its return type — update every caller in the same commit.

**Why:** Missing even one call site causes `TypeError` at runtime; exhaustive grep audit is the only way to confirm full coverage.
