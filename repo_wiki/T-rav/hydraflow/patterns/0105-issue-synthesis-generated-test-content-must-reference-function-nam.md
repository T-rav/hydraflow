# Generated test content must reference function names, not line numbers

Test skeletons, comments, and generated assertions must use exact function/class names for stability across refactors.

Example: `# tests path through calculate_drift()` not `# tests line 42 in drift.py`.

**Why:** Line numbers shift on every edit, making generated references immediately stale and misleading.
