# Use public FakeGitHub API in scenario tests

Always use the public API to mutate `FakeGitHub` state in scenario tests; never write to private attributes directly.

Example: Bad: `world.github._issues[901].state = "closed"`. Good: `await world.github.close_issue(901)`.

**Why:** If `FakeIssue` internals change, direct attribute writes silently remain valid Python while the fake's behavior drifts — the public API is the compatibility boundary.
