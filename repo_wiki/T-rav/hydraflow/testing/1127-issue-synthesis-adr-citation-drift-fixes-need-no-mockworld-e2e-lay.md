# ADR-citation drift fixes need no MockWorld/e2e layer — pure static check

For issue #10440 (fixing dead ADR source citations + adding a parser ratchet), the plan explicitly skips the MockWorld scenario and sandbox e2e test layers despite the repo's usual three-layer pyramid requirement (docs/standards/testing/README.md).

Example: the change is pure ADR-text plus a static test over a side-effect-free regex parser (_SOURCE_FILE_CITATION_RE) — it crosses no pipeline phase, runner, or Port.

**Why:** load-bearing-feature test-pyramid rules apply to features that touch runtime behavior; a text/static-analysis-only fix has no runtime surface for MockWorld or e2e to exercise, so skipping those layers isn't a shortcut here.
