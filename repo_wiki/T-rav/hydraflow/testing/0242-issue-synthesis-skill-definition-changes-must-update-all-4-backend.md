# Skill definition changes must update all 4 backend copies

HydraFlow skills replicate across `.claude/commands/`, `.pi/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`, and `src/*.py`. Use a manual `SKILL_MARKERS` mapping (not regex introspection) to validate all copies contain matching output markers via substring search. A single skill change can require updates across 3+ test fixture files.

**Why:** Updating fewer than 4 copies silently diverges behavior across execution environments with no test failure to signal the gap.
