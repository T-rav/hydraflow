# ADR citations must stay bare when fixing drift — no `:Symbol` tail

When amending an ADR to fix drift, do not upgrade a bare `src/triage_phase.py` citation to a `:Symbol`-qualified one and do not add new `src/...py` citations, even if the fix references a specific function like `triage_infra_parked`.

Example: `parse_adr_file`'s `source_files` set for the ADR must stay unchanged after the edit. See also: Symbol-qualify ADR citations on high-churn files to stop false drift (a distinct, proactive narrowing used on noisy registry files — not the same as widening scope mid-fix).

**Why:** widening citation scope beyond the drifted claim pulls unrelated code under that ADR's authority and breaks the narrow-scope contract regression tests check for (see `tests/regressions/test_issue_10304.py`).
