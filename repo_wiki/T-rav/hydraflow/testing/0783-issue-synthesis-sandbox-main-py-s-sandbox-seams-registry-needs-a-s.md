# sandbox_main.py's SANDBOX_SEAMS registry needs a seam per subprocess loop

`src/mockworld/sandbox_main.py` holds an air-gap seam registry (`SANDBOX_SEAMS`) — every new subprocess-spawning loop must register a seam (config-disable, seed, or mockworld-sentinel) here.

Example: completeness is enforced by `tests/architecture/test_sandbox_seam_completeness.py`, not by the ADR citation itself.

**Why:** the seam-completeness test is the real PR-time enforcement of the air-gap invariant; ADR-0052 citations should point to it (via Enforced-by) rather than relying on drift detection over the registry file.
