# Test direct-swap labels via swap_pipeline_labels(), not transitions

Labels set via atomic swap (`hitl-active`, `fixed`) bypass the transition graph and are applied by `swap_pipeline_labels()` — test them on that call path, not through `VALID_TRANSITIONS`.

See also: testing — Keep test label/stage constants synchronized with production definitions.

**Why:** Testing swap labels through the transition graph masks missing coverage; they have no transition entry by design.
