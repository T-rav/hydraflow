# Test Pydantic Literal constraints: cover both valid and invalid values

When adding `Literal` constraints to Pydantic fields, test both valid and invalid values — verify valid values are accepted and invalid values raise `ValidationError`.

Example: For `status: Literal['open', 'closed']`, test `status='open'` passes and `status='unknown'` raises.

**Why:** Literal constraints are invisible at runtime if only valid values are tested; invalid-value tests confirm the constraint is actually enforced.
