# PRManager changes (new methods or side effects) must be mirrored in FakeGitHub

When `PRManager` (`src/pr_manager.py`) gains a new query method, or a new side effect in an existing Port method, register the equivalent behavior in `FakeGitHub` (`src/mockworld/fakes/fake_github.py`) in the same change.

Example: an `isDraft`/`finditer` fix was mirrored into the fake alongside the real implementation; separately, when `close_issue` gained a side effect stripping active stage labels, `FakeGitHub.close_issue` was updated in the same PR.

**Why:** MockWorld scenario tests only catch loop-integration bugs if the fake actually replicates the real adapter's query semantics and side effects, not just its method signature — divergence gives scenario tests false confidence.
