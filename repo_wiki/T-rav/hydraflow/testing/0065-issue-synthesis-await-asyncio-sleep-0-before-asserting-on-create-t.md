# Await asyncio.sleep(0) before asserting on create_task() side effects

After triggering fire-and-forget async tasks via `asyncio.create_task()`, yield the event loop before making assertions.

```python
task = asyncio.create_task(fn())
await asyncio.sleep(0)
mock.assert_called_once()
```

**Why:** Without yielding, the created task has not yet run; assertions on its side effects will fail spuriously and non-deterministically.
