# detect_staleness floor: max(multiplier*interval, interval+max_cycle_s)

Floor `detect_staleness`'s threshold in `src/trust_fleet_anomaly_detectors.py` at `threshold_s = max(multiplier * interval_s, interval_s + max_cycle_s)` instead of a bare `multiplier * interval_s`, which false-positives on workers with short poll intervals but long work cycles.

Example: `staging_bisect` polls every 600s but has cycles up to 2700s; default `max_cycle_s=0` (keyword-only) keeps existing callers/tests unaffected, and `max_cycle_s` is included in the returned details dict for observability. See also: TrustFleetSanityLoop staleness tuning needs unit+regression+scenario layers.

**Why:** heartbeats only refresh on cycle completion (`src/base_background_loop.py`), so a healthy worker can legitimately lag one poll interval plus one full cycle — a flat multiplier misreads that as wedged.
