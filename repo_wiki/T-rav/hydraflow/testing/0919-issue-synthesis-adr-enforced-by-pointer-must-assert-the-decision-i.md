# ADR `Enforced by:` pointer must assert the decision itself

An ADR's `**Enforced by:**` pointer is only real enforcement if the target test asserts the actual behavioral claim — not merely touches a related symbol. ADR-0017's exclusion rule (`_maybe_decompose()` returning True must skip `increment_session_counter("triaged")`) had drifted to point at a test that referenced the counter but never checked the exclusion.

Example: repointing it at e.g. `test_state_mixin_decomposition.py` would satisfy a naive regex check while staying hollow; the real fix adds a test in `tests/test_triage_phase.py` asserting the counter delta is zero when `routing_outcome == "epic_decomposed"` and exactly one when `routing_outcome == "plan"`.

**Why:** a regex-satisfying but behaviorally-empty enforcement pointer is a silent-green hole — CI stays green even if the exclusion regresses.
