# MockWorld scenario N/A when fake runner can't fabricate the trigger

For #10393, the fake subprocess runner sets `.pid=None`, so a MockWorld scenario can never construct a fake with a sensitive pid (`1`/`os.getpid()`/`os.getppid()`) — the condition that triggers the bug.

Example: per `docs/standards/testing/README.md`'s three-layer pyramid, when a MockWorld layer genuinely cannot exercise the failure mode, the regression test's real-path exercise (real `terminate_processes` + real `os.killpg` spy) substitutes as the loop-integration coverage instead.

**Why:** documents when skipping a pyramid layer is a legitimate architectural constraint rather than the procedural failure the standard normally flags.
