# JS-rendered accessibility attributes require Playwright, not TestClient

Server-side `TestClient` (Django/FastAPI) returns only the initial HTML shell; `aria-labelledby` and other JS-rendered attributes are absent. Delete dead Python `TestClient` tests for these attributes and replace with Playwright tests.

**Why:** TestClient assertions on JS-rendered attributes always pass vacuously — the attribute is missing from the initial render, so assertions check an empty string or missing key.
