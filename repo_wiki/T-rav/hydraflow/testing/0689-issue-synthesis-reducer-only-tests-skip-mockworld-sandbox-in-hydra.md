# Reducer-only tests skip MockWorld/sandbox in HydraFlowContext.test.jsx

Pure reducer changes confined to `src/ui/src/context/HydraFlowContext.jsx` (no Ports, loops, or orchestrator touched) are tested with Vitest unit tests alone in `src/ui/src/context/__tests__/HydraFlowContext.test.jsx`.

Example: follow the existing `EPIC_READY`/`EPIC_RELEASING` 3As style (arrange state → dispatch action → assert one outcome). Per `docs/standards/testing/README.md`'s full pyramid rule, this is a deliberate exception since MockWorld/sandbox apply to cross-phase/loop integration.

**Why:** clarifies when skipping MockWorld/sandbox is correct scoping rather than a shortcut that violates the load-bearing test-pyramid rule.
