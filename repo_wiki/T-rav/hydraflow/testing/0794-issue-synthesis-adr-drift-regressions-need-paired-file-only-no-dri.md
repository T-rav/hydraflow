# ADR drift regressions need paired file-only-no-drift + symbol-still-drifts checks

When adding a `tests/test_adr_drift.py` regression for a citation fix, assert both directions: (1) a `compute_drift` run over a PR touching only the file (no symbol evidence) yields zero findings for that ADR, mirroring `test_real_adrs_do_not_drift_on_dependency_only_touches`; (2) a diff naming the qualified symbol still drifts, mirroring `test_symbol_citation_of_pr_manager_still_drifts`. Only the first assertion risks over-suppressing real regressions.

**Why:** a one-sided test (only checking no-drift) can't catch coverage being accidentally suppressed for genuine changes to the cited method.
