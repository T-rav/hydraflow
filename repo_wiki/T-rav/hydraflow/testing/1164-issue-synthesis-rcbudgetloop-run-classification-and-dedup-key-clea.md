# RcBudgetLoop run classification and dedup-key clearing test together

Test _fetch_recent_runs (src/rc_budget_loop.py) run-status classification alongside dedup-key clearing for rc_budget:{kind} keys, not in isolation.

Example: see tests/regressions/test_rc_budget_cancelled_run_misclassification_10215.py and tests/test_rc_budget_loop.py, covering a cancelled-run classification fix that required clearing dedup keys as one change.

**Why:** A run-status filtering fix that doesn't also clear stale rc_budget:{kind} dedup keys leaves the loop skipping reprocessing of reclassified runs (PR #10256, Fixes #10215).
