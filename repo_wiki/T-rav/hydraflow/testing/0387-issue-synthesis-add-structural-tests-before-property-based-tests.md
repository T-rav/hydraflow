# Add structural tests before property-based tests

Before running property-based tests on a transition graph, add structural tests: every target is a valid stage, every stage has a transition entry, and no dangling references exist.

Example: `assert set(VALID_TRANSITIONS.keys()) == VALID_STAGES`

**Why:** Property-based tests discover transition paths but silently skip unreachable states caused by structural gaps in the graph definition.
