# Test os.killpg paths with a spy, not a live signal, for CI safety

`tests/regressions/test_issue_10393.py` patches `os.killpg` as a spy and exercises the real `kill_process_group` / `runner_utils.terminate_processes` paths with fakes carrying sensitive `.pid` values (`1`, `os.getpid()`, `os.getppid()`).

Example: assert the spy is never called for those pids and that the fallback `proc.kill()` fires instead, proving the platform-divergent Linux-SIGKILL/macOS-EPERM bug is fixed without ever emitting a live signal.

**Why:** issuing a real `os.killpg` inside a test that runs under pytest risks killing the very process group running the test suite — the exact bug being regression-tested.
