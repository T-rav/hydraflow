# Doc+single-unit-test fixes skip MockWorld/e2e per testing standard

Not every change needs the full three-layer pyramid (unit + MockWorld scenario + sandbox e2e) from docs/standards/testing/README.md. A pure ADR-text repair plus one behavioral unit test in tests/test_triage_phase.py — with no change to src/triage_phase.py runtime logic, no new loop/runner, and no new git/gh/subprocess call — legitimately skips MockWorld and sandbox e2e, and skips the ADR-0049 kill-switch requirement too, since nothing new is being wired up.

Example: reserve full-pyramid ADR-0051 review cycles for load-bearing runtime/feature changes.

**Why:** applying the full test pyramid to a docs-only fix is process overhead that doesn't catch anything a unit test wouldn't; the standard is scoped to load-bearing features, not every touched file.
