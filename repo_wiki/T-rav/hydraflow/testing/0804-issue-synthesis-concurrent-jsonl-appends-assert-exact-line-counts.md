# Concurrent JSONL appends: assert exact line counts

Test concurrent JSONL-log operations (ADR-0021 persistence layout) with a fixed thread count and deterministic iteration count, then assert on exact line counts.

Example: `# 10 threads × 20 events = 200 total` followed by `assert len(lines) == 200`.

**Why:** Timing-based assertions are flaky; deterministic event counts make failures reproducible.
