# Symbol-qualify ADR citations on high-churn files to stop false drift

When an ADR cites a file that changes on every unrelated PR (e.g. src/mockworld/sandbox_main.py), narrow the citation to a symbol suffix like :main instead of a bare file path.

Example: src/adr_drift.py (#9176) only diffs at file granularity — a bare file citation flags drift on any touch, while a symbol-qualified one only flags drift when that specific symbol shows up in evidence. Used in ADR-0052 to stop routine per-loop seam additions from tripping the drift auditor. See also: ADR citations must stay bare when fixing drift (that rule governs widening scope during a content fix; this one is deliberate narrowing on noisy registry files).

**Why:** prevents recurring false-positive drift rollups on ADRs that cite registry-style files touched by every new-loop PR.
