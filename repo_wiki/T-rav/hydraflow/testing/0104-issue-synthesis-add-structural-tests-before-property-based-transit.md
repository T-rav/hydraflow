# Add structural tests before property-based transition graph tests

Before using hypothesis or similar tools to exercise a label/stage transition graph, add explicit structural assertions: every target is a valid stage, every stage has a transition entry, no dangling references.

Example: `assert set(VALID_TRANSITIONS.keys()) == VALID_STAGES`

**Why:** Property-based tests on a malformed graph surface as mysterious assertion failures rather than clear 'bad graph definition' errors.
