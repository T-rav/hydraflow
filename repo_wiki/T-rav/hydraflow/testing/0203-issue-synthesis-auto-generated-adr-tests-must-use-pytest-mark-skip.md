# Auto-generated ADR tests must use @pytest.mark.skip by default

When auto-generating tests from ADR Decision sections, emit all tests with `@pytest.mark.skip(reason='skeleton: requires human review')`. Extract only 4 high-confidence baseline patterns per ADR: uniqueness, usage, negative, coverage.

**Why:** Automated pattern matching on ADR language is ambiguous; unskipped generated tests produce false-positive CI failures until a human validates each pattern.
