# Fresh sandbox has no cadence marker — RC cut fires on tick 1

`StagingPromotionLoop`'s `_cadence_elapsed()` check (governed by `rc_cadence_hours`) is true by default when no prior cadence marker exists, so a scenario seeding a fresh sandbox doesn't need to fake or shrink the cadence to get an RC cut immediately.

Example: just run ≥2 ticks and assert via a full `/api/events` scan (not the latest page) to avoid timing flake.

**Why:** assuming cadence needs mocking leads to unnecessary scenario complexity; the real gotcha is asserting on the wrong event-page window.
