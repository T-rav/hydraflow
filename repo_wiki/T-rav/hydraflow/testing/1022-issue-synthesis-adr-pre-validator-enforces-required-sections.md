# ADR pre-validator enforces required sections

All ADRs must pass tests/test_adr_pre_validator.py, which enforces required sections (Status, Context, Decision, Consequences) and valid status values.

Example: see also architecture — ADR number collision and README guards.

**Why:** Missing sections or invalid status values make ADRs non-machine-readable, breaking automated drift detection and the ADR README completeness guard.
