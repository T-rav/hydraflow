# Loop default interval must be min() of all class-specific floors

`_get_default_interval` in `src/triage_retry_loop.py` must return `min(triage_retry_interval, triage_infra_retry_interval)`, not just the original 24h value.

Example: adding a shorter per-class retry floor without tightening the loop's own tick cadence leaves that floor dead code.

**Why:** if the loop's polling interval stays slower than a newly-added short floor, the loop never wakes up in time to act on it.
