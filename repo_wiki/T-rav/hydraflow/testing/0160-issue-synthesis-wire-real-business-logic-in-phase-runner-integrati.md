# Wire real business logic in phase-runner integration tests

Use real `StateTracker`, `EventBus`, and `VerificationJudge` instances in phase-runner integration tests; mock only the `_execute()` subprocess boundary. Provide configurable transcript strings for real runner parsing. Validate via `StateTracker` APIs and `EventBus.get_history()`, not mock call assertions.

**Why:** Fully-mocked runners hide mismatches between transcript parsing logic and real output formats — exactly the bugs integration tests exist to catch.
