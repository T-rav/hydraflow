# Mock only _execute() in phase-runner integration tests

In phase-runner integration tests, wire real `StateTracker`, `EventBus`, and `VerificationJudge`. Mock only the `_execute()` subprocess boundary with configurable transcript strings.

Example: validate state via `StateTracker` APIs and `EventBus.get_history()`, not mock call assertions.

**Why:** Fully-mocked runners hide parser mismatches between test transcripts and real output formats that only real parsers would catch.
