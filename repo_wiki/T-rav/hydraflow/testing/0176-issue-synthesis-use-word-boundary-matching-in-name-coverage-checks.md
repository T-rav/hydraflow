# Use word-boundary matching in name-coverage checks to prevent collisions

Substring matching in coverage or name checks produces false positives when short names appear inside longer ones.

- Bad: `'Foo' in text` — also matches `FooBar`, `PrefixFoo`
- Good: `re.search(r'\bFoo\b', text)` or full-name match

**Why:** Short-name collisions silently mark unrelated targets as covered, hiding real gaps in coverage.
