# ADR-0017's `_triage_single` naming went stale after the #6089/#6190 split

ADRs that name specific functions in their Context rot silently when those functions get extracted. ADR-0017 said both increment_session_counter("triaged") call sites lived in _triage_single, but the #6089/#6190 extraction moved them to _triage_adr (ADR fast-path) and _triage_single_traced (normal path, src/triage_phase.py:550).

Example: when splitting a function an ADR references by name, grep the ADR corpus for the old name before merging, or file a hydraflow-find issue immediately so drift doesn't wait for an unrelated PR rollup (like #10300) to surface it.

**Why:** no test caught this because ADR prose isn't type-checked; stale anchors mislead future readers into editing the wrong function and let "Enforced by" pointers rot unnoticed.
