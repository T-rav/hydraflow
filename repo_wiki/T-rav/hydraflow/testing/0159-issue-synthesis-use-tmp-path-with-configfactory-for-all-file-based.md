# Use tmp_path with ConfigFactory for all file-based test I/O

All tests that read or write files must use `tmp_path` combined with `ConfigFactory.create(base_path=tmp_path)` — never write to real project paths.

```python
def test_something(tmp_path):
    config = ConfigFactory.create(base_path=tmp_path)
```

**Why:** Tests writing to real project paths corrupt the working directory and produce hard-to-reproduce cross-test pollution.
