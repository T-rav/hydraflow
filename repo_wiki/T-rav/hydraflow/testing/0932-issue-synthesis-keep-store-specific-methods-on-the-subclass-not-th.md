# Keep store-specific methods on the subclass, not the shared ledger base

Keep store-specific methods like `AuditSampleLedger.update_dispositions` (`src/audit/store.py`) defined on the subclass rather than generalizing them into the shared `IdentifiedJsonlLedger[T]` base (`src/jsonl_ledger.py`).

Example: `update_dispositions` wasn't pulled into the base after the migration because no sibling store (`EscapeLedger`, `InterventionLedger`, `TrendStore`) needs it.

**Why:** pulling one-off, store-specific behavior into a shared base reintroduces coupling the unification was meant to remove.
