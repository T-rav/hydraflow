# New PRManager query methods must be mirrored in FakeGitHub

When adding a method like `find_open_resolving_pr` or `get_pr_checks` to `PRManager`, register the equivalent behavior in `src/mockworld/fakes/fake_github.py` (`FakeGitHub`) so both sides of the port stay conformant.

Example: this fix mirrored both the `isDraft` fix and the `finditer` fix into the fake alongside the real implementation.

**Why:** MockWorld scenario tests only catch loop-integration bugs if the fake actually replicates the real adapter's query semantics, not just its method signature.
