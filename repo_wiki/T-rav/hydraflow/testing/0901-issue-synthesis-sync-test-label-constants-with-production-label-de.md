# Sync test label constants with production label definitions

Keep test constants (`ALL_PIPELINE_LABELS`, `VALID_STAGES`, `VALID_TRANSITIONS`) synchronized with production definitions (ADR-0002 label state machine) via a sync test asserting set equality.

Example: `assert set(VALID_TRANSITIONS.keys()) == VALID_STAGES`.

**Why:** Stale test constants let new label additions pass CI without being exercised by the test suite.
