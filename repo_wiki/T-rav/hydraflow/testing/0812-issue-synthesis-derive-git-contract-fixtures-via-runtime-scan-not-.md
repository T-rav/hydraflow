# Derive git contract fixtures via runtime scan, not literal strings

In `tests/trust/contracts/test_fake_git_contract.py`, build `_invoke_fake_git`'s `"commit"` branch root-commit summary from a `_root_commit_summary()` helper that scans the actual fixture dir at test time, not a hardcoded f-string.

Example: scan file list + per-file insertion counts from `git_sandbox` at test time, so fake output stays in lockstep with fixture contents automatically.

**Why:** a hardcoded summary silently drifted from real `git commit` output whenever the `git_sandbox` fixture's file set changed, breaking `test_fake_git_matches_cassette[commit]` and `ContractRefreshLoop`'s self-heal cycle.
