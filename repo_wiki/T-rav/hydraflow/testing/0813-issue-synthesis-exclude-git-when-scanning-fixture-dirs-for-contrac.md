# Exclude `.git` when scanning fixture dirs for contract fakes

Any helper that walks `cassette.fixture_repo` to build fake git output (e.g. `_root_commit_summary()` in `test_fake_git_contract.py`) must filter with `".git" not in p.parts`.

Example: include `.gitkeep` and other dotfiles (no special-casing needed); exclude only the `.git/` path segment.

**Why:** a stray `.git/` left behind from an in-place `record_git` run corrupts file/insertion counts in the generated commit summary, since pathlib glob happily includes dotfiles/dotdirs like `.gitkeep` and `.git` alike.
