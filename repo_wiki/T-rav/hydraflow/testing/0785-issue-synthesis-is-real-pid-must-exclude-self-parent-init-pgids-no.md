# is_real_pid must exclude self/parent/init pgids, not just bool/0/negative

Exclude self/parent/init pgids in `is_real_pid` (`src/process_group.py`), not just `bool`, `0`, and negative values — extend the exclusion set to `{1, os.getpid(), os.getppid(), os.getpgrp()}`.

Example: without this, a fake `.pid` matching init (`1`), the test process, or its parent reaches `os.killpg` on the reaper's own process group, SIGKILLing the pytest run mid-suite on Linux (macOS masks it as a benign `EPERM`, so local runs pass while CI's `Coverage (trailing)` job gets CANCELLED with zero FAILED lines).

**Why:** platform-divergent signal semantics (EPERM on macOS vs success on Linux) hide this class of bug from local dev entirely — it only surfaces in CI.
