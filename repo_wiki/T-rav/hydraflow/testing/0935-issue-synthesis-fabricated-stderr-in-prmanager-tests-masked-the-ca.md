# Fabricated stderr in PRManager tests masked the cannot/can-not bug

Source fixture strings from actual `gh` CLI output verbatim in `PRManager` tests, rather than fabricating the expected error string.

Example: `tests/test_pr_manager_core.py::test_submit_review_raises_self_review_error_on_approve_own_pr` fed a fabricated `"Cannot approve your own pull request"` stderr, which passed even though production code and real GitHub CLI output disagreed; fixed by using the actual `"Review Can not approve your own pull request (addPullRequestReview)"` string.

**Why:** unit tests that fabricate the external error string instead of copying it verbatim can pass while the real integration is broken — for CLI/API wrapper code (`PRManager`), source fixture strings from actual tool output.
