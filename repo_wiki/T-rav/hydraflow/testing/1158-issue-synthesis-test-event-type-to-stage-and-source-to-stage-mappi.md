# Test EVENT_TYPE_TO_STAGE and SOURCE_TO_STAGE mappings separately

When testing the ADR-0002 label state machine, assert EVENT_TYPE_TO_STAGE and SOURCE_TO_STAGE against VALID_STAGES in separate assertions, not only their combined union.

Example: two distinct parametrized checks, one per mapping's keys.

**Why:** A combined check can pass while one mapping silently omits a new label.
