# Test EVENT_TYPE_TO_STAGE and SOURCE_TO_STAGE mappings separately

When testing the ADR-0002 label state machine, assert `EVENT_TYPE_TO_STAGE` and `SOURCE_TO_STAGE` against `VALID_STAGES` in separate assertions rather than only checking their combined union.

Example: two distinct parametrized checks, one per mapping's keys.

**Why:** A combined check can pass while one of the two mappings silently omits a new label, since only the union is verified.
