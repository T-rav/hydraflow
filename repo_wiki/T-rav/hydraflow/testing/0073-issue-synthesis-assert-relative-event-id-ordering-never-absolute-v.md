# Assert relative event ID ordering, never absolute values

Tests for events backed by a global counter (`_event_counter`) must assert relative ordering and uniqueness within one test, never absolute ID values.

- Good: `assert event_a.id < event_b.id`
- Bad: `assert event_a.id == 1`

**Why:** Global ID counters are shared across tests and imports; absolute assertions produce non-deterministic failures under parallel or reordered execution.
