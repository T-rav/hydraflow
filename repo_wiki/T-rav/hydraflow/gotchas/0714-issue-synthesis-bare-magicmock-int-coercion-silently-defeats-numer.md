# Bare MagicMock int-coercion silently defeats numeric floor logic in tests

Always stub `bg_workers.cycle_timeout.return_value` explicitly when testing threshold/floor math — a bare `MagicMock()` coerces to `int(mock) == 1` via `__int__`.

Example: `tests/test_trust_fleet_sanity_loop.py` and `tests/regressions/test_issue_10236.py` both stub this explicitly on the fake `bg_workers` object; without it, `int(bg.cycle_timeout(worker))` silently returns 1 instead of erroring.

**Why:** An unstubbed mock doesn't raise — it returns a plausible-looking wrong value (1), so the bug shows up as a confusing threshold mismatch rather than an obvious test error.
