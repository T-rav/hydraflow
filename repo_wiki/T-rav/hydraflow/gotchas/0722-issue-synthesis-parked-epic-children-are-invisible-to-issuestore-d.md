# Parked epic children are invisible to IssueStore — derive state from GH labels

Derive an epic's paused state from child GitHub labels directly, not from IssueStore — IssueStore's fetch excludes issues carrying `parked_label`, so parked children never appear in `_active`/`_in_flight`/queue lookups.

Example: `EpicManager._build_detail` (src/epic.py) inspects child GitHub labels directly to classify an epic as `paused` when all children are parked, then memoizes the result so the synchronous `get_progress` path can reuse it without re-fetching.

**Why:** Treating IssueStore as the sole source of truth for epic execution state silently misclassifies all-parked epics as `idle` instead of `paused`.
