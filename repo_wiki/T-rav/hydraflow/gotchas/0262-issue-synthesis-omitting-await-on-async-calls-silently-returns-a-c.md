# Omitting `await` on async calls silently returns a coroutine

Always `await` async method calls; storing an unawaited coroutine silently never executes its body.

Example: `result = fetch_data()` stores a `Coroutine` object; `result = await fetch_data()` executes it.

**Why:** Unawaited coroutines silently no-op; Pyright only catches them at `make typecheck` time when call sites have annotations.
