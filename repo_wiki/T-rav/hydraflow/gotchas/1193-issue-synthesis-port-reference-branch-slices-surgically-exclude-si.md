# Port reference-branch slices surgically — exclude sibling-child scope

When porting proven logic from a reference branch (e.g. `agent/issue-10411`) into a new issue's PR, pull only the commits/files relevant to the current issue and explicitly exclude sibling-child changes bundled in the same branch.

Example: for issue #10456, that meant taking the `_bare_citation_fanout` / `_citation_drifts` slice from commit 92c9a12c but explicitly NOT touching `src/state/_adr_audit.py`'s `adr_numbers` changes.

**Why:** Pulling in sibling-child changes causes scope bleed and merge conflicts when that sibling child lands its own PR later.
