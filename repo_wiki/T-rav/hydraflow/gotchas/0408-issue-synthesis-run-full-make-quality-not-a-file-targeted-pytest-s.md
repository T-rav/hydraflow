# Run full make quality, not a file-targeted pytest subset, before done

Always run the full `make quality` gate — never a file-targeted `pytest` subset — before declaring a task complete, especially for predicate-extraction or cleanup changes touching widely-used code like `_is_eligible` in `src/issue_store.py`.

Example: PR #8460 pruned defensive `getattr(self, "_X", None)` guards, ran 211 tests across three targeted files (all green), and shipped — but `make quality` would have caught 7 failures in `tests/test_audit_prompts.py` and `tests/test_repo_wiki_loop_pr.py`, requiring hotfix PR #8463.

**Why:** Targeted-file test runs give false confidence; changes to widely-used predicates have blast radius beyond the files they directly touch.
