# ADR-0012 has the same bare src/epic.py citation bug — file separately

ADR-0012 cites `src/epic.py` bare, same as ADR-0019 did before #10384's fix — but fixing it there won't close #10384 and is out of scope for that PR.

Example: file a separate issue for ADR-0012's citation fix rather than bundling it into an unrelated rollup-closing PR.

**Why:** Keeps PRs scoped to the rollup they're meant to close; bundling unrelated ADR fixes risks scope creep per `docs/wiki/architecture-refactoring.md` multi-PR drift discipline.
