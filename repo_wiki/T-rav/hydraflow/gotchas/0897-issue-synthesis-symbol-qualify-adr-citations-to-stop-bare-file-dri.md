# Symbol-qualify ADR citations to stop bare-file drift false positives

`src/adr_drift.py`'s `compute_drift`/`_citation_drifts` determines drift from `gh`'s file-level PR diff — it has no visibility into which symbols within a file changed, so a bare citation like `` `src/issue_fetcher.py` `` drifts on any touch to that file, even unrelated ones.

Example: PR #10417's `IssueFetcher._is_open` triggered ADR-0019 drift despite no cache/TTL logic change. Qualify with `:Symbol` — e.g. `src/issue_fetcher.py:IssueFetcher._get_collaborators` — so `_citation_drifts` only fires on symbol-level evidence, which production `gh` diffs rarely supply for untouched methods.

**Why:** Prevents recurring false-positive ADR drift rollups (ADR-0019 rollup #10433) without suppressing genuine regressions to the cited method.
