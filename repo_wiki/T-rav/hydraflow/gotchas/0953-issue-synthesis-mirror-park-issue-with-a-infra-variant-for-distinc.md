# Mirror park_issue with a *_infra variant for distinct park comments

Rather than branching inside `park_issue` (`src/phase_utils.py`), add a sibling `park_issue_infra(prs, issue_number, *, parked_label, error)` that posts a distinct "## Parked: Triage Infrastructure Failure" comment carrying the actual error text plus an HTML marker like `<!-- triage-infra-park -->`.

Example: fixes the generic "(no original parking reason captured)" fallback comment for infra-caused parks in `triage_phase.py`.

**Why:** Keeping cause-specific parking logic in dedicated functions keeps the marker/comment contract auditable per park reason and easy to grep for in issue history.
