# Use TYPE_CHECKING guards for forward-reference annotations

Use `from __future__ import annotations` with `TYPE_CHECKING` guards for forward-reference type annotations.

Example: `if TYPE_CHECKING: from mymodule import MyType` keeps the import from executing at runtime.

**Why:** Without the guard the symbol is evaluated at import time, creating circular imports or `ImportError` in modules that aren't always available.
