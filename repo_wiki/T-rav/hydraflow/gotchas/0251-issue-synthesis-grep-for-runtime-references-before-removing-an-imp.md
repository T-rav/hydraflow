# Grep for runtime references before removing an import

Before deleting an import, grep the file for runtime uses: `isinstance()` calls, variable assignments, and decorator calls.

Example: `grep -n 'MyClass' src/foo.py` — a hit in `isinstance(x, MyClass)` means the import is load-bearing even if type checkers flag it as unused.

**Why:** Ruff's `F401` rule does not inspect `isinstance` call sites; removing an apparently-unused import that is used at runtime produces `NameError`.
