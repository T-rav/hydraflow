# Run the pre-existing regression test red before implementing its fix

Confirm a pre-written regression test fails before implementing its fix, then make it pass — don't write the test after the fact.

Example: `tests/regressions/test_issue_10290.py` was authored before the fix for issue #10290 and had to reproduce the bug (infra parks sharing the 24h clarification floor) when run red; the plan also permits extending the regression's signal probe if it doesn't yet observe the new park-class/comment-marker surface.

**Why:** Confirms the regression test actually reproduces the bug rather than passing vacuously before and after the change.
