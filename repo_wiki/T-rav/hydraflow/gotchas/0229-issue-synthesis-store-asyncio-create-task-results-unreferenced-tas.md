# Store `asyncio.create_task()` results — unreferenced tasks are GC'd

Assign every `asyncio.create_task()` result to a set and add a done callback for error logging.

Example: `self._tasks.add(t := asyncio.create_task(work())); t.add_done_callback(self._tasks.discard)`.

**Why:** Tasks without a live reference are garbage-collected mid-execution, silently dropping their work and exceptions with no observable signal.
