# Patch functions at their definition site, not the import site

Always patch functions at where they are defined, not where they are imported into the module under test.

Example: `@patch('hindsight.retain_safe')` not `@patch('my_module.retain_safe')` when `my_module` imports from `hindsight`.

**Why:** Patching the import site only replaces that module's local reference; all other callers continue using the real function, making the mock ineffective.
