# New StateData fields need default_factory for schema-evolution safety

New optional dict/list fields on `StateData` (`src/models.py`) must use `Field(default_factory=dict)` (or equivalent), e.g. `triage_park_class: dict[str, str] = Field(default_factory=dict)`. This lets Pydantic populate the field when loading state files written before the field existed, instead of failing validation.

**Why:** hydraflow persists `StateData` across releases (ADR-0021); a required or no-default field breaks deserialization of every pre-existing state file on deploy.
