# Loop consolidation is a two-pass `_do_work`, not a merged single pass

When absorbing one loop's responsibility into another, drive the absorbed logic as a distinct second pass inside the host's `_do_work` rather than interleaving it into the first pass's control flow.

Example: `PRUnstickerLoop._do_work` runs the existing HITL unstick pass, then calls `PrRedIntake.run_once()` as a second, independently gated pass (skippable via `PRUnstickerLoop`'s kill-switch or `pr_red_repair_loop_enabled`).

**Why:** Keeping passes separate preserves independent enable-flag gating and avoids entangling two previously-independent failure/retry semantics into one code path.
