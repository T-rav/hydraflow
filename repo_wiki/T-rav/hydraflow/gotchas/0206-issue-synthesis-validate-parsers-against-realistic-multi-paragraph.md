# Validate parsers against realistic multi-paragraph agent output

Write parser tests against realistic multi-paragraph transcripts — prose interspersed with structured markers — not bare marker strings.

Example: test input should resemble real `claude` CLI output; assert on structured markers, not prose wording.

**Why:** Bare-marker tests pass even when the parser fails on the surrounding prose context present in real output, hiding real format regressions.
