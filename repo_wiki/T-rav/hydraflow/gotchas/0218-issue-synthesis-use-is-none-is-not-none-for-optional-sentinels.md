# Use `is None` / `is not None` for optional sentinels

Prefer identity checks (`is None`, `is not None`) over equality checks for optional objects, especially callables and stores.

Example: `if callback is None: return` — not `if callback == None`.

**Why:** Identity checks are O(1) and immune to overridden `__eq__`; equality checks against `None` can accidentally match falsy custom objects with a permissive `__eq__`.
