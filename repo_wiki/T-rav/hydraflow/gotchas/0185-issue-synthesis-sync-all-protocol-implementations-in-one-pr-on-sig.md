# Sync all protocol implementations in one PR on signature change

When a port or protocol method signature changes, update every concrete implementation atomically in the same PR — never staggered across tasks.

Example: adding `ctx: Context` to `def process(self, item)` requires changing every class implementing the protocol before merging.

**Why:** Staggered updates leave implementations out of sync with the protocol, causing Pyright errors that block CI until every site is updated.
