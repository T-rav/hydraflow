# ADR citation fix PRs self-close rollups: no src/ touch means no self-drift

A PR that only edits `docs/adr/*.md` to upgrade a bare citation to `:Symbol` granularity touches no `src/` files, so it introduces no new drift against itself — the triggering rollup issue (e.g. #10434) auto-closes on the next `RepoWikiLoop`/auditor tick after merge with no follow-up action needed.

**Why:** Confirms these fixes are self-contained and don't require a manual rollup-closing step, unlike code changes that can retrigger the same ADR's drift check.
