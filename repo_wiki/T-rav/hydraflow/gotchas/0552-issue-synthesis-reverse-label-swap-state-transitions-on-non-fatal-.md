# Reverse label-swap state transitions on non-fatal exceptions

Wrap label-swap + operation + cleanup in try/except and reverse the transition on non-fatal errors, per the ADR-0002 labels-as-state-machine model.

Example: if a label is swapped `plan → implement` but the follow-up API call fails, swap it back to `plan` before re-raising.

**Why:** An exception after a successful state transition but before cleanup leaves issues stuck in intermediate label states with no automated recovery path.
