# Worker-held issue accessor must union active and in-flight sets

Provide a worker-held accessor on `IssueStore` (`src/issue_store.py`) that unions `_active` ∪ `_in_flight`, not `_active` alone.

Example: the dequeue→mark_active window means an issue can be claimed by a worker but not yet in `_active` — it's tracked in `_in_flight` during that gap; checking `_active` alone misses issues mid-pickup and flips an epic to `queued` instead of `running`.

**Why:** Narrow state checks that ignore transitional/in-flight windows produce flaky, timing-dependent classification bugs.
