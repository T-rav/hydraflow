# Concurrent planner pools must share max_planners semaphore, gap review too

When making epic-group planning and standalone planning run concurrently (e.g. via `asyncio.gather` in `plan_issues`, `src/plan_phase.py`), every code path that consumes a planner slot — including epic gap review — must acquire the same `max_planners` semaphore.

Example: gap review wasn't semaphore-guarded before this change; running it alongside the standalone pool without adding that guard oversubscribes past `max_planners`.

**Why:** Concurrency without a shared bound turns a capacity limit into a race condition that only shows up under load.
