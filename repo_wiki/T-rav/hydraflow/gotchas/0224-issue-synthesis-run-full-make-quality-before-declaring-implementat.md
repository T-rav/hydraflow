# Run full `make quality` before declaring implementation complete

Always run the full `make quality` gate — never a file-targeted test subset — before declaring a task done.

Example: `pytest tests/test_foo.py` passes; `make quality` reveals 7 failures in `test_audit_prompts.py` caused by the same change.

**Why:** Targeted runs miss cross-module regressions; cleanup PRs have higher blast radius than their diffs suggest.
