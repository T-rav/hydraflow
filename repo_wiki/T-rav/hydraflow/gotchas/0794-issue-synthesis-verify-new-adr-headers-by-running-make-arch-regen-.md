# Verify new ADR headers by running make arch-regen before committing

After drafting a new ADR file, run `make arch-regen` and inspect `docs/arch/generated/adr-conformance.md` to confirm the new ADR appears with a non-"missing" Enforcement kind, and that `adr_cross_reference` resolves every Related/Refines link — don't hand-verify header shape by eye.

Example: ADR-0108's plan mitigates "dangling metadata" risk by cloning ADR-0102's header shape (`**Status:**`, `**Enforcement:** enforced`, `**Enforced by:**`) and checking regenerated output before commit.

**Why:** A missing Enforcement kind or a Related/Refines link to a nonexistent file fails `adr-conformance`/xref CI, and `make quality` won't catch it until arch-regen is actually run.
