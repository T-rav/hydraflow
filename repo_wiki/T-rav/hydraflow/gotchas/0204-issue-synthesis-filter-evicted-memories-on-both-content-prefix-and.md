# Filter evicted memories on both content prefix AND metadata status

Apply dual filters when loading recalled memories: check both the `[EVICTED]` content prefix and `status: evicted` in metadata before injecting into prompts.

Example: `if mem.content.startswith('[EVICTED]') or mem.metadata.get('status') == 'evicted': skip`.

**Why:** A single filter has a failure path; if one guard is missing or malformed, a tombstone leaks into agent prompts and produces confusing or incorrect agent behavior.
