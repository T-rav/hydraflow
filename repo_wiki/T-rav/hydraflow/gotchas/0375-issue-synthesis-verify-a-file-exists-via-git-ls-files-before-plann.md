# Verify a file exists via git ls-files before planning an edit to it

Before adding a plan task that edits a specific file, confirm the file exists via `git ls-files <path>`.

Example: `git ls-files src/shared_prompt_prefix.py` returning empty means the file never existed — update the plan before implementation starts.

**Why:** Planning tasks against nonexistent files wastes implementation work and causes confusing "file not found" failures mid-execution.
