# FakeGitHub must back promotion-PR reads with real state, not stubs

`FakeGitHub` (src/mockworld/fakes/fake_github.py) can cut an RC branch/PR but its `find_open_promotion_pr`, `list_recent_promotion_prs`, and `list_rc_branches` don't see it again unless `create_rc_branch`/`create_promotion_pr` record state into an explicit promotion-PR number set and rc-branch map.

Example: a standard `create_pr` (issue_number>0) must never be returned by `find_open_promotion_pr` — distinguish by explicit ID set, not base-branch/issue heuristics, or `StagingPromotionLoop` can grab a normal agent PR.

**Why:** Silent stub returns make MockWorld-tier promotion scenarios (e.g. `StagingPromotionLoop` cut→find→merge) pass trivially without exercising the real read path.
