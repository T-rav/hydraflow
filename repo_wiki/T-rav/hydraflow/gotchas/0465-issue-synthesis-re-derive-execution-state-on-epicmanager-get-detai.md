# Re-derive execution state on EpicManager.get_detail cache hits, not just on write

Re-derive derived/live-state fields (like `execution`) even on a cache hit, not just at cache-write time.

Example: `EpicManager.get_detail` (src/epic.py) uses a 60s detail cache; the fix for issue #10299 re-derives `execution` on every call using live worker-held/queued accessors, so a worker pickup or queue drain inside the 60s window is reflected immediately.

**Why:** Caching for performance is fine, but caching a derived-from-live-state field silently freezes it, defeating the purpose of a real-time execution badge.
