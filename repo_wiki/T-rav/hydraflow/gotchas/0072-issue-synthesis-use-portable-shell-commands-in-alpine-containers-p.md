# Use portable shell commands in Alpine containers — Python is absent

In Alpine-based Docker containers, avoid Python and non-standard utilities. Use portable POSIX commands for memory/CPU operations.

Example: `dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=32 of=/dev/null` or `head -c 33554432 /dev/zero > /dev/null` instead of a Python `bytearray` allocation.

**Why:** Alpine's minimal tooling excludes Python and many GNU utilities; scripts that rely on them fail with `command not found` in constrained CI environments.
