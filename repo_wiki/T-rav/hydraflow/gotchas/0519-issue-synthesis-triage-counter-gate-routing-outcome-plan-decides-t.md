# Triage counter gate: routing_outcome == "plan" decides the triaged counter

In `src/triage_phase.py`, the `"triaged"` session counter (`increment_session_counter`) is only incremented when `routing_outcome == "plan"` (line ~547-550), not whenever an issue finishes triage.

Example: `_maybe_decompose(issue, result)` returning True sets `routing_outcome = "epic_decomposed"` (line 383) and short-circuits past that gate, so decomposed issues are deliberately excluded. `_triage_adr` and `_triage_single_traced` are the two call sites that can reach the `"plan"` branch.

**Why:** Anyone adding a new triage routing outcome needs to know the counter is opt-in via `"plan"`, not opt-out, or they'll silently miscount session stats.
