# Classify GitHub review errors on stable core phrase, not full sentence

In `PRManager.submit_review`'s `except RuntimeError` handler, match error text on core phrases (`"approve your own pull request"`, `"request changes on your own pull request"`) rather than the full sentence including `cannot`/`can not`, so classification survives GitHub varying its exact phrasing.

Example: the generic-failure path (no phrase match) still returns `False` — don't broaden the match so far it swallows unrelated review failures.

**Why:** Full-sentence matching against an external service's error text is brittle to minor wording changes; core-phrase matching is robust without over-broadening into false positives.
