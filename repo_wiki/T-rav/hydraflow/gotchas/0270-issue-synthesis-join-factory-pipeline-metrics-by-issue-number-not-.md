# Join factory pipeline metrics by issue_number, not pr_number

When correlating factory metrics or reviews across pipeline tables, join on `issue_number` rather than `pr_number`.

Example: a PR can be closed and recreated with a new number; `issue_number` is stable across the full lifecycle.

**Why:** `pr_number` changes when PRs are recycled; joining on it silently drops or duplicates records for any issue where the PR was recreated.
