# adr_reviewer.py logs pre-validation advisories via logger.warning, not routing

After calling `validate(...)` in `src/adr_reviewer.py`, any `validation.advisories` should be logged with `logger.warning` using a literal format string — do not pass them to `_route_pre_validation_failure`, which is reserved for `issues`.

Example: this keeps the ADR flowing to council even when advisories exist.

**Why:** Reusing the issue-routing path for advisories would gate ADRs on a warning-only signal, defeating the point of a non-blocking nudge.
