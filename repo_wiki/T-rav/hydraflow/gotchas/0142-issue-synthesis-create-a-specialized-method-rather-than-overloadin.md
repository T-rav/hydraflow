# Create a specialized method rather than overloading a general one

When a general method returns insufficient data for a specific use case, create a separate focused method rather than adding optional parameters.

Example: `list_issues_by_label()` returns basic metadata; `get_issue_updated_at()` handles timestamps in a separate call.

**Why:** Overloading general methods couples unrelated concerns and complicates callers that need only one piece of data.
