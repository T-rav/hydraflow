# Keep record_git docstring in sync with its actual fixture, not a stale example

`src/contract_recording.py`'s `record_git` docstring referenced a "hello.txt" example that no longer matches the real fixture (now a 3-file `git_sandbox`).

Example: stale docstring examples in contract-recording code are easy to miss because they don't fail tests directly — they only surface when someone trusts the docstring while debugging a cassette mismatch and gets misled about what the recorder actually captures.

**Why:** Contract-recording docstrings double as onboarding docs for `ContractRefreshLoop` maintenance; drift here costs future debugging time even though `make quality` won't catch it.
