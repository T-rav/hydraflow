# Tag park class at park time so retry floors can diverge by cause

When a state machine has multiple park reasons sharing one retry mechanism, store the cause explicitly rather than inferring it later.

Example: `StateData.triage_park_class` (`src/models.py`) records `"infra"` vs `"clarification"` at the moment `triage_phase.py` parks an issue, so `triage_retry_loop.py` applies a 30min floor to infra parks and keeps the 24h floor for clarification parks. Default `get_triage_park_class` to `"clarification"` when unset.

**Why:** Without a stored class, an infra outage (transient `RuntimeError` from `triage.evaluate()`) freezes the backlog for a full day because it can't be distinguished from a real needs-info park.
