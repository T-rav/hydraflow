# Bundled tracking issues can hide two independent, unverified fixes

A single tracking issue can bundle unrelated fixes in one PR — don't assume a single root cause when auditing history.

Example: PR #10256 bundled the `rc_budget_loop` cancelled-run misclassification fix with an unrelated timeout guard for `tests/scenarios/browser/workflows/test_orchestrator_controls.py`, both tracked under issue #10215, with regression coverage in `tests/regressions/test_scenario_browser_timeout_guard_10215.py`.

**Why:** Treating a bundled PR as one fix causes an auditor to miss that one of the two subsystems (rc_budget dedup logic vs. Browser Scenarios timeout handling) was never actually verified.
