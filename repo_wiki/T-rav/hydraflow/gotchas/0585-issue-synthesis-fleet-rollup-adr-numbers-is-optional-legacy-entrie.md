# Fleet rollup `adr_numbers` is optional — legacy entries read as empty

`src/state/_adr_audit.py`'s `get/set/all_adr_rollups` treats `adr_numbers` as an optional additive field (no migration): legacy `FLEET-<pr>` entries filed before this change round-trip with an empty list rather than erroring.

Example: `adr_touchpoint_auditor_loop.py` persists the member ADR numbers when filing a fleet rollup.

**Why:** Lets the resolver enumerate fleet members without importing `adr_drift.py` detection logic, preserving the resolver's never-edit-the-detector invariant, while keeping old rollups safely inert (one-shot human-close) instead of breaking.
