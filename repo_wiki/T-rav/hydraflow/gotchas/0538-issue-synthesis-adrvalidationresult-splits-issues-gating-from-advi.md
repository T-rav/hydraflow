# ADRValidationResult splits `issues` (gating) from `advisories` (non-gating)

When adding a lint that should nudge but not block, add it to a new `advisories: list[ADRValidationIssue]` field on `ADRValidationResult` in `src/adr_pre_validator.py`, not to `issues`.

Example: `passed` and `has_fixable_only` stay keyed on `issues` only, so `adr_reviewer.py`'s council-skip check (`adr_reviewer.py:183`, which skips council on any `issue`) never sees advisories. The #10419 shared-infra bare-citation nudge lives entirely in `advisories`.

**Why:** Putting a non-blocking check into `issues` silently turns a warning into a hard gate that blocks council review — this is the #1 pre-mortem risk called out for that change.
