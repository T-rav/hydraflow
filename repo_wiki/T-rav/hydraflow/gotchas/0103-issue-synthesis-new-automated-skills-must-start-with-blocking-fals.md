# New automated skills must start with blocking=False until stable

Register new dynamic skills with `blocking=False` and graduate to `blocking=True` only after ≥20 runs at ≥95% success rate.

Example: a new lint-skill marked `blocking=True` on day one fails builds on edge cases the author didn't anticipate.

**Why:** Unproven blocking skills immediately break CI on legitimate code; graduated promotion ensures checks are stable before they can gate merges.
