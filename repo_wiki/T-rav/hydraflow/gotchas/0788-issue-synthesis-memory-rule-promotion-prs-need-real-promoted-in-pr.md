# Memory-rule promotion PRs need real promoted_in PR# and Closes # in body

When flipping a memory rule from "remembered" to "structurally enforced" (ADR-0089), the mirror file (e.g. `docs/wiki/memory-feedback/feedback-monitor-fix-merge-prs.md`) frontmatter must be updated to `status: promoted` with the actual PR number in `promoted_in` (filled after `gh pr create`, not a placeholder), and the PR body must contain `Closes #<issue>`.

**Why:** A placeholder `promoted_in` or missing `Closes #` lets `MemoryBacklogLoop` re-file the same rule as an open backlog item.
