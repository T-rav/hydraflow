# Update _emit_trace command strings when migrating subprocess to Port

After replacing a `gh`/subprocess call with a Port method, update any `_emit_trace` or telemetry command strings to reflect the new surface.

Example: Old: `command=["gh", "issue", "list", "--label", "wiki-rot-stuck"]`. New: `PRPort.list_closed_issues_by_label("wiki-rot-stuck", limit=50)`.

**Why:** Observability consumers rely on command strings to diagnose failures; stale strings misdirect operators toward subprocess debugging when the actual call path is a Port method.
