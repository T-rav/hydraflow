# Delete code blocks bottom-to-top to avoid line-number shifting

When removing multiple code blocks from the same file in a single session, delete the lowest block first (highest line number) and work upward.

Example: delete lines 120–130 before deleting lines 80–90; reversing the order shifts targets for the second deletion.

**Why:** Deleting a higher block shifts all lower line numbers; later deletions then target wrong lines or miss content entirely.
