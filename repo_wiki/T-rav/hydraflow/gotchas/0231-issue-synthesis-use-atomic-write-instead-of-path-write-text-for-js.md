# Use `atomic_write()` instead of `Path.write_text()` for JSON state

Write JSON state files via `file_util.atomic_write()`, not `Path.write_text()`.

Example: `atomic_write(state_path, json_str)` writes to a `.tmp` sibling then renames atomically — a crash mid-write leaves the original intact.

**Why:** `Path.write_text()` truncates before writing; a crash mid-operation produces a zero-byte or partial JSON that fails to parse on restart, corrupting persisted state.
