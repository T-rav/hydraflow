# Reverse state transitions on non-fatal exceptions to avoid stuck

Wrap label-swap + operation + cleanup in a try/except that reverses the transition on non-fatal errors.

Example: if a label is swapped `plan → implement` but the API call fails, swap it back to `plan` before re-raising.

**Why:** An exception after a successful state transition but before cleanup leaves issues stuck in intermediate states with no automated recovery path.
