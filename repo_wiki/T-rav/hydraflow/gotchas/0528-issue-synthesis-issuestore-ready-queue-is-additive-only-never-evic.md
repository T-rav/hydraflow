# IssueStore ready queue is additive-only — never evicts on poll

`IssueStore._route_issues` (issue_store.py:335) only adds queued tasks; existing queued items are never removed by polling, even if the fetcher stops returning them.

Example: combined with fetchers that only return OPEN issues, a `hydraflow-ready` issue queued while open stays queryable via `get_implementable`/`_take_from_queue` after it closes — re-stamping `hydraflow-in-progress` and spinning a new worktree on a closed issue. Any new eviction logic must gate on a complete fetch (mirror the existing `_eagerly_transitioned` prune) so a transient fetch failure doesn't wrongly evict a live OPEN issue.

**Why:** Prevents re-dispatching closed work and prevents over-eager eviction from dropping in-flight issues.
