# Separate silent-with-result events from purely silent in dispatch

In event dispatch tables, distinguish events that produce no display output but set a result value from events that are truly silent.

Example: check `_SILENT_WITH_RESULT` before `_SILENT_EVENTS` so result-setting events are routed correctly.

**Why:** Treating silent-with-result events as purely silent discards their return values, causing downstream state to silently receive `None` instead of the real result.
