# New Pydantic fields must have defaults for existing state compat

Add new fields to Pydantic models as `field: Type = default_value` — never as required fields — so existing serialized state files continue to deserialize.

Example: `retry_count: int = 0` allows old state JSONs that lack the key to load without error.

**Why:** A required field with no default causes `ValidationError` on every existing persisted object, breaking recovery from saved state on the first restart after deploy.
