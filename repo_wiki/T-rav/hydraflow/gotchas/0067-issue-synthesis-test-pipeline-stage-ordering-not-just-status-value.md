# Test pipeline stage ordering, not just status values, after inserting a stage

After inserting a new stage into `PIPELINE_STAGES`, assert both that the stage's status value is correct and that its array index is correct.

Example: inserting a stage at index 2 shifts all downstream indices; a test checking only `status == 'active'` passes while skip-detection silently breaks.

**Why:** Index-based progression logic produces incorrect skip decisions when stages are reordered, with no immediate test failure.
