# Derive stage-label sets from config, never hardcode label lists

When code needs "all active pipeline stage labels" (e.g. to strip on close, or to scan for drift), add a single property like `active_stage_labels` in `src/config.py` and have every consumer (`PRManager.close_issue`, `LabelDriftWatcherLoop._reconcile`, `FakeGitHub.close_issue`) read from it — never re-list labels inline.

Example: terminal labels like `hydraflow-fixed` must be explicitly excluded from this set so caretaker/terminal semantics survive.

**Why:** A hardcoded list drifts from ADR-0002's label state machine the moment a new stage label is added, silently breaking close/drift logic.
