# Use `TypedDict(total=False)` for backward-compatible payloads

Define event payload TypedDicts with `total=False` so all fields are optional, allowing old producers and new consumers to interoperate.

Example: `class MergePayload(TypedDict, total=False): pr_number: int; labels: list[str]`.

**Why:** A `total=True` TypedDict requires all fields; adding a new field breaks any existing producer that doesn't include it, preventing rolling deployments.
