"""Shape-validating dispatchers for LiveCorpusReplayLoop (Phase 5 of #8786).

The first dispatcher to populate ``LiveCorpusReplayLoop``'s registry. Rather
than mirror every gh call shape through a per-method ``FakeGitHub`` invocation
(needs careful state seeding to be meaningful), this dispatcher validates the
sampled stdout against the matching Pydantic shape from
``contracts.shapes``. A validation failure IS the drift signal — gh changed a
field, removed one, or returned a new enum value.

Why this is useful before per-method dispatchers exist:

- Shape drift is the *highest-frequency* drift in practice. New gh versions
  add fields; removed fields break downstream parsers. Catching that at
  shadow-corpus replay time means we hear about it within one tick
  (~15 min), not when a production loop crashes parsing the new shape.
- Zero state-seeding required. The dispatcher is purely defensive against
  upstream changes, not a fake-correctness check.
- Adding per-method value-comparison dispatchers later doesn't conflict —
  they'd register under different ``(adapter, command)`` keys or the same
  key with a richer body that still validates first.

The dispatcher returns ``None`` when validation succeeds (sample matches the
shape — no drift). On validation failure it returns a dict that surfaces the
expected shape vs the sampled payload, which the loop diffs to produce the
drift signature. The signature is stable across reruns of the same drift.
