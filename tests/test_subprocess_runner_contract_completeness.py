"""Factory validation: every lightweight LLM spawn detects credit exhaustion (WS-2.2).

The lightweight (``run_simple``) spawn path NEVER raises ``CreditExhaustedError``
— credit-out arrives as ``rc != 0`` TEXT. So a module on that path that does not
detect credit (via the ``run_lightweight_agent`` helper, which scans + raises, or
its own ``raise_if_credit_exhausted`` / ``is_credit_exhaustion`` scan) misclassifies
a billing signal as a generic failure and burns attempt budget — the
``run-simple-agent-spawn-no-credit-detection`` audit finding.

SCOPE: this ratchet checks that each lightweight spawner module *contains* a
credit detector call. It does NOT prove the raised ``CreditExhaustedError``
reaches a pause handler — a caller that catches ``RuntimeError`` (its superclass)
one layer up still swallows it. Per-loop credit PROPAGATION must be covered by a
behavioral test at the loop boundary (e.g. assert ``CreditExhaustedError``
escapes ``_do_work``). ``_GRANDFATHERED`` must stay EMPTY.
